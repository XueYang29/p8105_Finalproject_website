#  **Motivation**

Vital statistics including birth and mortality data is of critical importance in assesssing community health status. Birth rate, leading cause of death and mortality rate often serve as cornerstone in formulating public health policies. 

Motality data, for example, offers a snapshot of current health problems and knowing the causes of death, especially the avoidable and treatable ones, helps us to establish intervention for better outcomes. By investigating the trend of a specific cause of death over time, we can also identify consistent risk in a specific groups and evaluate the effect of a certain public health policy. Disparity in mortality rate, premature death and cause of death in different race and gender can indicate socioeconomic inequility.

Birth data, on the other hand, will directly influence the total population which may have effect on the calculation of the measures of disease occurrence. At the same time, birth rate may also be influenced by the maternal issue, such as maternal age, nativity and so on. So analysing on the birth data can help us identify the issue that may cause the increase or decrease of the birth counts, which can further help us to identify the construction of the total population.
